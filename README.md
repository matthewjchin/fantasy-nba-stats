<h1>Fantasy NBA Player Stats Lookup</h1>

This will be a web application that will allow users to search up their desired NBA player and search up their 
basketball stats, current or former. 

Suitable for fantasy drafts and trades, sports betting, and even statisticians and gurus. Anyone can use this easily 
accessible website for their chance to know more about these individual statistics. Since there are some numbers that 
may not be available to the public or through online sportsbooks, the goal is to promote the availability of these 
numbers for users before placing a wager, trade, or draft on their players of choice. 

<h2>Updates</h2>
1/31/24: Currently the project in the initial development stage. Stay tuned for updates. 
Added Heroku integration; website deployment can be found at the temporary URL below:
https://nbaplayerstats-243062f5955c.herokuapp.com/
<br>
2/9/24: Added store_data.py file. Demonstrates backend feature of collecting data from the NBA API Python library. 
The details on the library can be found as [nba_api on GitHub](https://github.com/swar/nba_api), giving much credit to
the repository for being able to easily access NBA.com to provide statistics of NBA players for users to have for this
site. The goal is to save any users' search information from the webpage onto the SQLite database. 
<br>
2/19/24: Trying to add features to get an NBA active player's stats. Used to include for loop which searched entire
active players' API and return normalized JSON to user.
