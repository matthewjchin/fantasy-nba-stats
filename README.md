<h1>Fantasy NBA Player Lookup</h1>

This will be a web application that will allow users to search up their desired NBA player and search up their 
basketball stats, current or former. 

Suitable for fantasy drafts and trades, sports betting, and even statisticians and gurus. Anyone can use this easily 
accessible website for their chance to know more about these individual statistics. Since there are some numbers that 
may not be available to the public or through online sportsbooks, the goal is to promote the availability of these 
numbers for users before placing a wager, trade, or draft on their players of choice.
